Demo shop with simple backend
=====

This code exists because I managed to say this at a demo I was conducting,
showing off some basic unit-testing of angular.js apps: "Now, we can simply
write a sinatra backend with mongodb and start making money!"

Well, here it is (at least the parts needed to support the demo...).

Implemented:
* Load categories from the DB
* Load a single category

The demo is changed as little as possible (only removing the mock backend
service).
